# Android Image Cropper

ðŸš© **The Project is currently maintained** ðŸš©  
Please use [CanHub's fork](https://github.com/ictfoysal/Android-Image-Cropper-byFt)!  
Thank you everybody for using the library. It was very fun to create and a privilege to help you build awesome apps.  
The same way I took an unmaintained initial implementation from edmodo, I'm happy to see CanHub taking it now.  
Good luck and happy coding! :octocat:
